# Delhivery Feature Engineering and Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and feature engineering workflow on Delhivery's logistics data, focusing on trip and route optimization. The notebook performs data preprocessing, feature engineering, and provides actionable insights to optimize resource allocation and delivery performance

About the Project



Delhivery, one of the largest logistics and supply chain service providers in India, handles a vast network of deliveries across the country. Effective trip planning and route optimization are crucial for ensuring timely deliveries while minimizing costs. This project aims to identify inefficiencies and provide insights that can improve the overall operational efficiency.

Objective
The main objective of this project is to:

Engineer meaningful features that can help predict trip performance and identify potential inefficiencies in delivery routes.
Compare the predicted performance from OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine) to actual delivery data, highlighting deviations and suggesting areas for improvement.
Analyze the distribution of delivery orders across different geographical regions and states in India to optimize resource allocation.
Scope of Work
The project focuses on:

Feature Engineering: Crafting new features that represent deviations in predicted trip metrics such as distance and time.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the distribution of deliveries across regions, states, and zones to identify patterns and trends.

Recommendations: Based on the analysis, actionable insights are provided to help optimize the trip planning and resource allocation process.

Routing Engine Review: Analyzing the routing engine's predictions (OSRM) and identifying discrepancies to ensure trip planning aligns with real-world performance.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains various delivery-related parameters:

Trip Details: Includes information about the start and end points of delivery, duration, and distance covered.

Routing Predictions: OSRM-generated estimates for trip distance and time.

Geographical Information: Regions and states where the deliveries took place.

Timestamps: Data capturing the actual times of delivery, pickup, and drop-off.
Preprocessing
Missing Values Handling: Any missing or null values were appropriately treated to maintain data consistency.
Normalization: Numerical columns were normalized to standardize the data, improving model performance.
Categorical Encoding: Regions and states were encoded for easy interpretation in analysis.
Features
The following features were engineered to aid the analysis:

Distance Deviation: The difference between the predicted and actual distance for each trip.

Time Deviation: The difference between predicted and actual trip time.

Zone Traffic Analysis: A feature that highlights the volume of deliveries across different geographical zones.

State-Level Traffic Analysis: A deeper analysis on the number of deliveries handled by each state.
